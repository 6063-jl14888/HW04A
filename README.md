In this assignment, we needed to create a clock, but it doesn't necessarily have to be presented in the traditional clock form.

The code can represent the passage of time through movement, blinking, or changing colors. I'm very interested in circular shapes performing actions on the screen, like bouncing, and I enjoy that. So, this time, I chose to use circles as the main element. I expressed time by their ordered movements in different directions.

I wanted to use different circles to create a "clock" for seconds, minutes, and hours. After that, I attempted to:

The orange circle in the frame represents seconds. It moves up or down once every second. The green ball moves at half the speed, meaning it represents two seconds with each movement.

I used purple and blue balls on the screen to represent minutes. They move at the same speed but in opposite directions, changing size every second. Their path is an ellipse around the center of the screen. A complete ellipse represents two minutes, half an ellipse represents one minute.

Finally, the central circle in the middle of the screen represents hours. Its size increases from small to large over a 24-hour cycle. After 24 hours, it returns to its initial size to start a new cycle.

During the creation process, it was important to distinguish between the positions, directions of motion, and names of each circle (as there were many), as forgetting to distinguish them could lead to code errors. I also had to consider the layering relationships between each shape to make the screen more aesthetically pleasing. Arranging their colors and vertical positioning added to the visual appeal. The most interesting part was seeing the final result and feeling like I had created something uniquely my own.

If I get the chance, I would like to try irregular shapes like flowers or stars in the future.
